# Mark II

You can [reserve your own Mark II](https://mycroft.ai/product/reserve-your-mark-ii-with-a-small-deposit/) with a small deposit.

## Constructing your Dev Kit

Being a development kit, there's a small amount of construction required.

We have put together a detailed set of instructions to help get you setup. These instructions include the laser cut enclosure, 3D printed audio chamber and camera module.
